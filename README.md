# next-ts-template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It also comes configured with:

- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier)
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

## Getting Started

### Configuring Husky

```bash
npm run prepare
```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
